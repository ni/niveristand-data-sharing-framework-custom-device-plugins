# Data Sharing Framework Plugins
The **Data Sharing Framework Plugins** provides built components to the [Data Sharing Framework](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-data-sharing-framework-custom-device) and its VeriStand Custom Device for reflecting data between applications.

## Validated Plugin and Target Support
This repository contains three Data Sharing Framework plugins:
1. UDP
1. GE Reflective Memory
1. RDMA

Each plugin supports a different set of targets. The following table displays the plugin support status for each target type.

|Plugin|Windows|PXI Linux x64|cRIO Linux x64|
|---|---|---|---|
|UDP|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|
|GE Reflective Memory|:heavy_check_mark:|:x:|:heavy_minus_sign:|
|RDMA|:heavy_minus_sign:|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_minus_sign:|

- :heavy_check_mark: - Supported, validated, and building.
- :x: - Potentially supported, not currently validated or building.
- :heavy_minus_sign: - Not supported.
